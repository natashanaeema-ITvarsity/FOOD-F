                <P>Misadventures, Drones, Photography, Itineraries, Opinions, Our Two Cents, Videos, The Best and Worst Countries To Travel To If You Have Food Allergies, Part Time Travel and More!!!! Oh Yeah, and this is definitely not the blog for you if you want to learn how to travel light! </P>
              <P>So that was the brief synopsis! But who are we really? Well I am CLAIRE JOHNSON, a native Coloradan that got the taste for travel when I studied abroad in Ireland my Junior year of College. Which is actually where I met my Husband, Robert the second very important part of this travel blog --- he is my travel partner in crime! He hails from a quintessential Irish village, located in the West coast of Co. Clare. The best and most beautiful part of Ireland....but I might be biased. </P>
             <P>Back to the travel bug! I have been lucky enough to have a family that loves to travel and grew up traveling for most of my life. For a long while we went to the same countries (I am def not complaining) and never really branched out until the year I went to Ireland...That was in 2012. At that point in my life I had been to seven countries and fast forward six years and that amps up to 25ish and counting countries! So, that is what I mean when I say it was not until that trip that we got the bug for travel!</P>
              <P>While I totally admire those that can travel and do travel full time, we do not do that. To start, we have four dogs, horses and birds. It is hard to travel full time when you have so many animals --- and we miss them dearly when we are gone. We do not always travel just the two of us, we are blessed enough to be able to travel with and to our families. </P>
             <P>I also love planning travel! There is something very satisfying to me about looking up flights, researching hotels and learning as much as I can about a place before I even go there. I plan all of my own vacations as well as my family vacations. I like to think that I am an expert at planning the type of travel me and my family love! My hopes in creating this blog is to share that passion and love for traveling we have. Maybe you have never left the country or you are a world class traveler - take a gander at the blog and find some inspiration to follow your dreams. </P>
              <P>Also, sometimes I feel like I am allergic to every type of food there is out there, when really I am only allergic to about 42 foods that I know of. This is not me complaining - but I have learned a few things about traveling with food allergies and I know how hard it can be - especially when there is a language barrier. On this blog you will find my personal tips and the best and worst countries I have traveled tp when it comes to being allergic. My three biggest allergies are Gluten, Wheat and Dairy (except I can eat butter and eggs). </P>
                    <P> We are passionate about travel, adventure, photography and videography. I hope that you will join us and find what you are looking for through our adventures once had.</P>
